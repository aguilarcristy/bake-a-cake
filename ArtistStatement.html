    <p style="font-family": 'Poppins'; color:White; font-size:35px;"> Welcome to "bake-a-cake," a cute, interactive game that lets you bake a cake for a friend
    and live with consequences of your actions weighing on your mind!

    This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! In addition to this, a p5.play library has been
    implemented to allow the game to feature short animations.

    This was inspired by some character designs I created last year. I love anything cute, but
    cute without a catch isn't much, hence my decision to create this game, and set the mood
    and tone for it via its questions, answers, and wording!

    Have fun!
