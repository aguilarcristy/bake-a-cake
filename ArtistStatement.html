  Welcome to "bake-a-cake," a cute, interactive game that lets you bake a cake for a friend
      and live with consequences of your actions weighing on your mind!

      This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! In addition to this, a p5.play library has been
      implemented to allow the game to feature short animations.

      This was inspired by some character designs I created last year. I love anything cute, but
      cute without a catch isn't much, hence my decision to create this game, and set the mood
      and tone for it via its questions, answers, and wording!

<br>
<br>
      Have fun!
